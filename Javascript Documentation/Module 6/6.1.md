# 6.1 Introduction to testing in JavaScript

In this module, you'll learn about the importance of testing in JavaScript and different types of testing. You'll also be introduced to popular testing frameworks for JavaScript and the Test-driven development (TDD) approach.

Testing is an essential part of the software development process. It helps to ensure that your code works as expected and catches bugs and errors before they make it into production. There are several types of testing, including unit testing, integration testing, functional testing, and end-to-end testing.

In JavaScript, there are several popular testing frameworks, including Jest, Mocha, and Jasmine. These frameworks provide tools for writing and running tests, generating reports, and measuring code coverage.

Test-driven development is an approach to software development that emphasizes writing tests before writing code. This approach helps to ensure that the code is testable, and that it meets the requirements and specifications.

Throughout this module, you'll learn how to write and run tests with Jest and Cypress, two popular testing frameworks for JavaScript. You'll also learn about mocking and stubbing, which are important techniques for testing code that relies on external dependencies. Finally, you'll learn about code coverage and how it can help you measure the effectiveness of your tests.
