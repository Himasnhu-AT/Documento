# 6.2 Unit testing with Jest

Jest is a popular JavaScript testing framework developed by Facebook, which is widely used for unit testing. Jest provides a simple and intuitive API for writing tests, and it comes with built-in assertion functions and mocking utilities, which makes it easy to write and run tests for JavaScript code.

To use Jest, you need to install it using npm or yarn, and then create a test file for each JavaScript module or function that you want to test. A test file in Jest typically has the same name as the module or function it's testing, with a `.test.js` extension.

Here's an example of a simple test file for a `sum` function:

```javascript
// sum.js
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

module.exports = sum;
```

```javascript
// sum.test.js
const sum = require('./sum');

test('adds 1 + 2 to equal 3', () => {
  expect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3);
});
```

In this example, we define a `sum` function in `sum.js`, and export it using the `module.exports` statement. In `sum.test.js`, we import the `sum` function using `require`, and then define a test case using the `test` function provided by Jest. The `expect` function is used to define the expected result of the test, and the `toBe` matcher is used to check that the actual result of calling `sum(1, 2)` is equal to `3`.

To run the test file, you can use the `jest` command in your terminal:

```
$ jest sum.test.js
```

Jest will execute the test case and report the results in the terminal:

```
 PASS  ./sum.test.js
  ✓ adds 1 + 2 to equal 3 (5ms)
```

If a test case fails, Jest will provide a detailed error message to help you identify the problem:

```
FAIL  ./sum.test.js
  ✕ adds 1 + 2 to equal 4 (6ms)

  ● adds 1 + 2 to equal 4

    expect(received).toBe(expected) // Object.is equality

    Expected: 4
    Received: 3

      3 | 
      4 | test('adds 1 + 2 to equal 4', () => {
    > 5 |   expect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(4);
        |                      ^
      6 | });

      at Object.<anonymous> (sum.test.js:5:22)

Test Suites: 1 failed, 1 total
Tests:       1 failed, 1 passed, 2 total
```

In addition to `test` and `expect`, Jest provides many other functions and matchers that you can use to write more complex and comprehensive tests. It also supports asynchronous testing, mocking and stubbing, and code coverage measurement, which are covered in other sections of this module.
