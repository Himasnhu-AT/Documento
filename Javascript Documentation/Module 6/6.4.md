# 6.4 Mocking and Stubbing

Mocking and stubbing are techniques used in testing to simulate dependencies and their behavior. They allow developers to test a unit of code in isolation by replacing actual dependencies with mock or stub objects that mimic their behavior.

Mock objects are used to simulate complex objects that are difficult to set up or maintain for testing. They can be created using Jest's `jest.fn()` function. This function creates a new, empty mock function that can be customized to simulate the behavior of the original function. For example, if a function calls an API to retrieve data, a mock function can be created to simulate that behavior, without actually making an API call. 

```javascript
// Example of mocking a function using Jest
const myFunction = jest.fn(() => 42);
expect(myFunction()).toBe(42);
expect(myFunction).toHaveBeenCalled();
```

Stub objects, on the other hand, are used to replace a dependency with a simple, predetermined behavior that allows the code under test to execute. This can be useful when the actual behavior of the dependency is not important to the test, or when it is difficult to set up a complex dependency for testing. 

```javascript
// Example of stubbing a function using Jest
const myFunction = jest.fn();
myFunction.mockReturnValue(42);
expect(myFunction()).toBe(42);
```

By using mock and stub objects in testing, developers can ensure that their code works as expected, even when dependencies are unavailable or their behavior is unpredictable. This can lead to more reliable and maintainable code, as well as faster testing and debugging.
