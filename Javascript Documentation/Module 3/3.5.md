# 3.5 Practice Examples and Coding Challenges

To reinforce the concepts covered in this module, here are some practice examples and coding challenges:

- Create a class called Person with properties for name, age, and gender. Add a method to the class called greet() that logs a greeting to the console.

- Create a class called Student that extends the Person class. Add a property to the Student class for major and override the greet() method to include the student's major in the greeting.

- Create a class called Teacher that extends the Person class. Add a property to the Teacher class for subject and override the greet() method to include the teacher's subject in the greeting.

- Create a class called Shape with properties for width and height. Add a method to the class called getArea() that returns the area of the shape.

- Create a class called Rectangle that extends the Shape class. Add a method to the Rectangle class called getPerimeter() that returns the perimeter of the rectangle.

- Create a class called Circle that extends the Shape class. Add a method to the Circle class called getCircumference() that returns the circumference of the circle.

- Create an array of Shape objects that includes both Rectangle and Circle objects. Iterate over the array and log the area, perimeter (if it's a rectangle), or circumference (if it's a circle) of each shape to the console.

- Create a class called ShoppingCart with properties for items (an array) and total (a number). Add methods to the class for adding items to the cart, removing items from the cart, and calculating the total price of the items in the cart.

- Create a class called Book with properties for title, author, and price. Add a method to the class for formatting the book's information as a string in the format "Title by Author ($XX.XX)".

- Create an array of Book objects and add them to a ShoppingCart object. Use the methods of the ShoppingCart object to add and remove books from the cart and calculate the total price. Use the Book class's method for formatting the book information to log the contents of the cart to the console.
