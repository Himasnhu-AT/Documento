# 3.3 Encapsulation and inheritance

Encapsulation is the concept of hiding the implementation details of an object from its outside environment, and only exposing a public interface through which other objects can interact with it. In JavaScript, encapsulation can be achieved through the use of closures and the module pattern.

Inheritance is the mechanism of creating new objects from existing objects. In JavaScript, inheritance is achieved through the prototype chain. Each object in JavaScript has a prototype, which is itself an object, and can be used to inherit properties and methods from other objects. When an object is created, it is linked to its prototype, and can access any properties or methods defined on it.

JavaScript also supports a form of inheritance called prototypal inheritance, which allows objects to inherit directly from other objects, rather than from classes as in traditional inheritance. This allows for more dynamic and flexible object creation and manipulation.

By combining encapsulation and inheritance, object-oriented programming in JavaScript allows developers to create complex and reusable code, with objects that have their own state, behavior, and inheritance hierarchy.
