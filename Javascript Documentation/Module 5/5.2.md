# 5.2 Angular

Angular is a popular JavaScript framework for building web applications. It is maintained by Google and is known for its scalability, modularity, and performance. Angular is built on top of TypeScript, a statically-typed superset of JavaScript that adds features such as type checking and interfaces.

One of the key features of Angular is its component-based architecture. Components are the building blocks of an Angular application, and each component represents a part of the user interface. Components can be nested inside one another to create complex user interfaces.

Angular also has a powerful dependency injection system, which makes it easy to manage dependencies between different parts of an application. This can help to keep code organized and modular.

Another important feature of Angular is its use of directives. Directives are used to add behavior to HTML elements, such as event handling or data binding. Angular comes with a number of built-in directives, and it is also possible to create custom directives.

In addition to components and directives, Angular also has the concept of services. Services are used to provide functionality that can be shared across multiple components. For example, a service might be used to fetch data from a server, or to manage user authentication.

Angular also includes built-in support for routing, which makes it easy to create single-page applications. With Angular's routing system, it is possible to create multiple views within a single page, without needing to reload the entire page.

Overall, Angular is a powerful framework that can be used to create complex and scalable web applications. Its component-based architecture, dependency injection system, and built-in support for directives and services make it a popular choice for building modern web applications.

## Code Example:
Sure, here are some code examples for Angular:

### Example 1: Creating a Component

To create a component in Angular, we use the `@Component` decorator. Here's an example:

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  template: `
    <h1>Welcome to {{title}}!</h1>
    <p>{{description}}</p>
  `,
})
export class AppComponent {
  title = 'My Angular App';
  description = 'This is a sample Angular app.';
}
```

This component has a `selector` of `app-root`, which means it can be included in an HTML template like this:

```html
<app-root></app-root>
```

When the component is rendered, the `title` and `description` properties will be interpolated into the template.

### Example 2: Using a Service

Services are used to share data or functionality between components in Angular. Here's an example service:

```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class DataService {
  data = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'];

  getData() {
    return this.data;
  }
}
```

This service has a `data` property, which is an array of strings, and a `getData` method, which returns that array.

To use this service in a component, we can inject it into the component's constructor:

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { DataService } from './data.service';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  template: `
    <h1>My Data:</h1>
    <ul>
      <li *ngFor="let item of data">{{item}}</li>
    </ul>
  `,
})
export class AppComponent {
  data: string[];

  constructor(private dataService: DataService) {}

  ngOnInit() {
    this.data = this.dataService.getData();
  }
}
```

In this example, we inject the `DataService` into the `AppComponent` constructor, and then call its `getData` method in the `ngOnInit` lifecycle hook. We then use Angular's `*ngFor` directive to loop through the `data` array and display each item in a list.

### Example 3: Handling User Input

In Angular, we can use event binding to handle user input. Here's an example:

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  template: `
    <h1>My App</h1>
    <input #nameInput type="text">
    <button (click)="sayHello(nameInput.value)">Say Hello</button>
  `,
})
export class AppComponent {
  sayHello(name: string) {
    alert(`Hello, ${name}!`);
  }
}
```

In this example, we use the `#nameInput` template reference variable to get a reference to the input element. We then use the `(click)` event binding to call the `sayHello` method when the button is clicked, passing in the value of the input element as an argument. The `sayHello` method then displays a message using the `alert` function.
