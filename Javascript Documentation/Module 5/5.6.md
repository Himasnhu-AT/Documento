5.6 Practice examples and coding challenges

Examples:

- Angular Example: Create a simple calculator using Angular, where the user can input two numbers and select an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division). The output should display the result of the selected operation on the two input numbers.

- React Example: Create a simple to-do list using React, where the user can add, delete, and mark items as complete. The to-do list should be stored in the component state and rendered dynamically as the user adds or deletes items.

- Vue.js Example: Create a weather app using Vue.js, where the user can input a city name and retrieve the current weather conditions for that city. The app should communicate with a weather API and display the current temperature, weather description, and a weather icon.

Challenges:

- Using Angular, create a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application for managing a list of books. The application should have a form for adding new books, a table for displaying the existing books, and buttons for editing and deleting books.

- Using React, create a real-time chat application that allows users to send and receive messages in real-time. The application should use a server-side API for sending and receiving messages and update the UI in real-time as new messages are received.

- Using Vue.js, create a simple e-commerce application where users can browse and purchase products. The application should have a product catalog, a shopping cart, and a checkout process. It should also communicate with a server-side API for retrieving and storing product and order data.
