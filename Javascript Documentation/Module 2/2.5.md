# 2.5 Practice examples and coding challenges

In order to reinforce the concepts covered in Module 2, it is important to practice writing JavaScript functions and manipulating arrays. Here are some simple examples to get started:

- Write a function that takes an array of numbers as an argument and returns the sum of all the numbers in the array.

- Write a function that takes an array of strings as an argument and returns the length of the shortest string in the array.

- Write a function that takes an array of numbers as an argument and returns a new array with all the even numbers in the original array.

These are just a few examples of the types of functions and array manipulations that can be practiced. It is important to experiment and come up with your own challenges to really solidify your understanding of these concepts.

In addition to practice problems, there are many online resources available for further learning and practice. Some recommended resources include:

- Codecademy's JavaScript course
- Mozilla's JavaScript Guide
- Eloquent JavaScript by Marijn Haverbeke
- FreeCodeCamp's JavaScript algorithms and data structures certification course
By practicing and learning from these resources, you can become proficient in using functions and arrays in JavaScript programming.
