# 2.2 Parameters and return values

In JavaScript, functions can accept parameters, which are values that are passed into the function to be used as inputs. Parameters are defined inside the parentheses of the function declaration and separated by commas. For example:

```
function greet(name) {
  console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
}
```
In this example, name is the parameter that is passed into the greet() function. When the function is called with a value for name, the function will use that value to generate a personalized greeting.

When a function is called, it can also return a value back to the caller. The return keyword is used to specify the value that should be returned. For example:

```
function multiply(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}
```
In this example, the multiply() function accepts two parameters, a and b, and returns their product. The returned value can then be stored in a variable or used in another part of the code.

By using parameters and return values, functions become more flexible and reusable. They can be customized to perform different tasks depending on the input parameters, and their return values can be used to pass data between different parts of a program.
