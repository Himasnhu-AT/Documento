# 4.3 Promises

Promises are another approach to asynchronous programming that was introduced in ES6. A Promise represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. Promises simplify asynchronous programming by providing a more structured way to handle asynchronous operations and their results.

A Promise has three states: pending, fulfilled, and rejected. The pending state represents the initial state of the Promise, before it has been resolved. Once a Promise is resolved, it can be either fulfilled, with a value that represents the successful completion of the operation, or rejected, with a reason that represents a failure.

To create a Promise, you can use the Promise constructor and pass it a function that takes two arguments, resolve and reject. Within this function, you can perform your asynchronous operation and call resolve with the resulting value when the operation completes successfully, or reject with an error if it fails. 

Here is an example of a Promise that resolves after a delay of 1 second:

```
const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve("Hello, world!");
  }, 1000);
});

myPromise.then((result) => {
  console.log(result); // logs "Hello, world!" after 1 second
});
```

In the example above, we create a new Promise that resolves after a delay of 1 second using `setTimeout()`. The `then()` method is called on the Promise to handle the fulfillment of the Promise. The callback function passed to `then()` receives the resolved value of the Promise as its argument.

Promise chaining is a technique for sequencing asynchronous operations. By returning a new Promise from the `then()` method of a previous Promise, you can create a chain of Promises that will execute in sequence. 

The `Promise.all()` method can be used to handle multiple Promises at once. It takes an array of Promises as its argument and returns a new Promise that is fulfilled with an array of the resolved values of the input Promises, in the order they were passed to `Promise.all()`. If any of the input Promises are rejected, the returned Promise will be rejected with the reason of the first rejected Promise.

```
const promise1 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve("Hello");
  }, 1000);
});

const promise2 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve("world!");
  }, 2000);
});

Promise.all([promise1, promise2]).then((results) => {
  console.log(results); // logs ["Hello", "world!"] after 2 seconds
});
```
