# 4.4 Async/await

Async/await is a new way to write asynchronous code that is available in modern versions of JavaScript. It allows developers to write asynchronous code that looks and feels like synchronous code. Async/await works by using the `async` keyword to define a function as asynchronous, and the `await` keyword to wait for the result of an asynchronous operation.

When a function is defined as `async`, it automatically returns a Promise. Inside the `async` function, `await` can be used to wait for the result of another asynchronous function or operation. The code after the `await` keyword will not be executed until the operation is complete and the result is returned.

Here's an example of how to use async/await to make an API request and retrieve data:

```javascript
async function getData() {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
}

getData().then(data => console.log(data));
```

In this example, the `getData` function is defined as `async`, which allows us to use the `await` keyword to wait for the response of the API request. The `fetch` method returns a Promise that resolves to a Response object, which we can then use the `json()` method to parse the response body and return the data as an object.

Using `await` with `fetch` allows us to wait for the API response to be returned before moving on to the next line of code. Once the data is retrieved, it is returned as a Promise and can be accessed with a `.then()` callback.

Async/await makes it easier to write asynchronous code that is more readable and easier to understand. It also provides a simpler error handling mechanism than traditional callback-based asynchronous code.
