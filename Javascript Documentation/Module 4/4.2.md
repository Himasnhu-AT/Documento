# 4.2 Callbacks

In JavaScript, a callback is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed after its parent function has completed its task. Callbacks are a fundamental concept in asynchronous programming, allowing for the execution of code while other code is running.

One common use case for callbacks is in handling events. For example, a click event on a button can be handled with a callback function that runs when the button is clicked. Another use case is in making asynchronous requests, where a callback function is executed once the request has been completed.

Callbacks can be anonymous functions or named functions, and they can be declared inline or separately. When used in asynchronous programming, it's important to handle errors properly to avoid unexpected behavior. Callback functions are often associated with "callback hell," a situation where nested callbacks become difficult to read and manage.

Here's an example of using a named function as a callback:

```
function printResult(result) {
  console.log(result);
}

function add(a, b, callback) {
  const result = a + b;
  callback(result);
}

add(2, 3, printResult); // prints 5
```
In this example, the add function takes two numbers and a callback function as arguments. After performing the addition, it calls the callback function with the result as the argument.

Note that the callback function printResult is declared separately and passed as an argument to the add function. When the add function finishes its task, it executes the printResult function with the result as the argument.

Callbacks are an important building block of asynchronous programming, but they can become unwieldy when used extensively. To avoid "callback hell," developers often turn to other techniques like Promises or async/await.
