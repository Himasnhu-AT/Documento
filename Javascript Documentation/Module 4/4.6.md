4.6 Practice examples and coding challenges

Here are some practice examples and coding challenges to reinforce the concepts covered in this module:

Practice Examples:
- Write a function that uses callbacks to fetch data from an API and log it to the console.
- Write a function that uses promises to fetch data from multiple APIs and return the results as an array.
- Convert a callback-based function to use promises.
- Write a function that uses async/await to fetch data from an API and return it as an object.

Coding Challenges:
- Write a function that uses promises to fetch data from an API and transform it using the .map() method.
- Write a function that uses async/await to fetch data from two different APIs and combine the results into a single object.
- Write a function that uses callbacks to fetch data from an API and create an HTML table from the results.
- Write a function that uses promises to fetch data from an API and return the average of a specific property in the response data.

These practice examples and coding challenges will help you to apply the concepts covered in this module and gain more experience with asynchronous JavaScript programming.
