# 1.1 What is JavaScript and its uses
JavaScript is a high-level programming language that is primarily used to create interactive web pages. It was first introduced in 1995 by Brendan Eich while he was working at Netscape Communications Corporation and has since become one of the most widely-used programming languages on the web.

## Introduction to JavaScript as a programming language
JavaScript is a client-side scripting language, which means that it runs on the user's browser rather than on the server. This allows JavaScript to interact with HTML and CSS to create dynamic and responsive user interfaces. By using JavaScript, developers can create web applications that are more engaging and user-friendly.

## Explanation of how JavaScript is used to make web pages interactive
JavaScript can be used to create interactive user interfaces, form validation, DOM manipulation, animations, and interact with APIs. By using JavaScript, developers can create web pages that are more engaging and user-friendly.

## Examples of JavaScript in action
Some common examples of JavaScript in action include dropdown menus, form validation, moving objects, fading in and out of elements, transitions between pages, and displaying data from external APIs like Google Maps.

## Conclusion
JavaScript is a versatile and powerful programming language that is essential for web development. By learning JavaScript, developers can create engaging and interactive web applications that provide a great user experience.
