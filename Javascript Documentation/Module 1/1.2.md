# 1.2 Setting up a development environment
## Explanation of code editors and integrated development environments (IDEs)
A code editor is a software application that allows developers to write and edit code. It typically includes features like syntax highlighting, code completion, and error checking. Some popular code editors for JavaScript include Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, and Atom.

An integrated development environment (IDE) is a more comprehensive software application that includes not only a code editor, but also features like a debugger, version control integration, and project management tools. Some popular IDEs for JavaScript include WebStorm, Eclipse, and NetBeans.

## How to install and set up a code editor like Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text
To install a code editor, simply download the installer from the website of your chosen editor and follow the installation instructions. Once installed, you can open the editor and start writing code.

## Introduction to web browsers and their developer tools (e.g. Chrome DevTools)
Web browsers are software applications that allow users to access websites on the internet. Most modern web browsers also include developer tools that allow developers to inspect and debug web pages.

One popular set of developer tools is Chrome DevTools, which is built into the Google Chrome web browser. It includes features like an element inspector, a JavaScript console, and a network monitor.
