# 1.3 Variables and Data Types
## Variables
In JavaScript, variables are used to store and manipulate data. A variable is a container that holds a value, and this value can be changed throughout the program.

To create a variable in JavaScript, you use the var, let, or const keyword followed by the variable name. For example, to create a variable called name that holds a string value, you can write:

javascript
``` 
let name = "John";
```
Here, let is the keyword used to declare a variable, name is the variable name, and "John" is the value assigned to the variable.

## Data Types
JavaScript has several built-in data types that can be stored in variables:

- String: A sequence of characters, enclosed in single or double quotes. Example: "Hello, world!".
- Number: A numeric data type that includes integers, floating-point numbers, and exponential notation. Example: 42, 3.14.
- Boolean: A data type that can be either true or false.
- Null: A data type that has only one value: null. It represents a deliberate non-value, indicating the absence of any object value.
- Undefined: A variable that has not been assigned a value has the value undefined. It also represents the absence of a value, but unlike null, it is unintentional.
- Object: A collection of key-value pairs, represented by {} or new Object().
- Array: An ordered list of values, represented by [] or new Array().
In JavaScript, variables do not have a fixed data type. They can hold values of any data type, and the data type of a variable can change at any time. This is known as "dynamic typing".

## Declaring Variables
To declare a variable in JavaScript, you can use the var, let, or const keyword followed by the variable name. For example:

```
var age = 25; // using var
let name = "John"; // using let
const PI = 3.14; // using const
```
var is the oldest way to declare a variable in JavaScript, but it is still widely used. Variables declared with var have a function scope, meaning they are only accessible within the function in which they are defined.

let was introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) and is recommended over var. Variables declared with let have a block scope, meaning they are only accessible within the block in which they are defined.

const is also introduced in ES6 and is used to declare variables that should not be re-assigned a new value. Variables declared with const also have a block scope.

## Hoisting
Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their respective scopes before code execution. This means that you can use a variable or a function before it has been declared.

For example:

```
console.log(x); // outputs "undefined"
var x = 5;
```
Here, even though x has not been declared before being used in the console.log statement, it does not throw an error. Instead, x is "hoisted" to the top of its scope and assigned the value undefined.

It's important to note that only variable declarations are hoisted, not variable initializations. For example:

```
console.log(x); // outputs "Uncaught ReferenceError: x is not defined"
let x = 5;
```
In this code, the variable x is declared with let, which means that it is not hoisted. When the console.log() statement is executed, x has not yet been declared, so an error is thrown.

In addition to var and let, JavaScript also has a third keyword for declaring variables: const. Variables declared with const are similar to those declared with let, but they cannot be reassigned once they are assigned a value. This can help prevent accidental changes to important values in your code.

Overall, understanding variable scope and hoisting is important for writing clean and bug-free JavaScript code.
