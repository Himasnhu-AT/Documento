# To-Do List for Documento
This is a to-do list for the Documento repository. Here are some tasks that need to be completed:

- Add documentation for more programming languages, such as Rust and Go, and complete ongoing ones.
- Update existing documentation to include the latest language features and best practices.
- Improve the organization of the repository by creating separate folders for each language.
- Add more examples and code snippets to the documentation to help beginners understand the language.
- Create a contribution guide for developers who want to contribute to the documentation.
- Implement a feedback system to allow users to suggest improvements or report errors in the documentation.
- Provide links to additional resources, such as tutorials and videos, for each programming language.
- Add support for multiple versions of a programming language, so users can choose the version they want to learn.

If you would like to contribute to Documento and help us complete these tasks, please see the Contributing section of the README.md file for instructions on how to get started.
